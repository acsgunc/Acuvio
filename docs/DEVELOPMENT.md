# Acuvio — Development Document

> **Goal:** Evolve **Acuvio** (a Tauri 2 + Angular + CodeMirror 6 log analyzer)
> into a modern text/code editor with **feature parity with Notepad++**, while
> preserving the existing architecture wherever practical.

This document is the single source of truth for the feature roadmap. It captures
**every feature** requested in [`Prompt.md`](../Prompt.md), maps each one to the
**current state** of the Acuvio codebase, and tracks progress.

> Per-feature deep-dive documentation lives in
> [`docs/features/`](features/README.md).

## 3. Recommended Implementation Order

Editing the document model is the unlock for most phases. Suggested sequence:

1. **Editable document model** — make CodeMirror editable + Save/Save As
   (enables Phase 3, Replace, undo/redo).
2. **Configuration system** (Phase 12) — needed by nearly every later feature.
3. **View toggles** — Word Wrap, Zoom, Minimap, Code Folding (Phase 2).
4. **Syntax highlighting + language registry** (Phase 5).
5. **Code editing** — bracket match, autocomplete, snippets (Phase 6).
6. **File Explorer** (Phase 7).
7. **UI** — command palette, themes, shortcut customization (Phase 9).
8. **Productivity** — diff, macros, clipboard history (Phase 10).
9. **Crash recovery / backup** (Phase 11).
10. **Plugin architecture** (Phase 8) — last, once the API surface is stable.

> **Trade-off note:** Phases 3, 4 (Replace), 6, and 10 depend on an **editable**
> document model. Acuvio is currently a read-only viewer optimized for GB-scale
> mmap files. Editing GB files in place is a different problem from editing
> normal source files. Recommendation: keep the **read-only mmap viewer** for
> huge logs and add a separate **editable buffer mode** for regular files,
> selected automatically by file size threshold.

## 4. Scripts Reference

All build/maintenance scripts live in [`scripts/`](../scripts/) and are wired
through `package.json`.

| Script | npm command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generate-icon.mjs` | `node scripts/generate-icon.mjs` | Generate the base app icon (PNG) before `tauri icon`. |
| `generate-sample-log.mjs` | `node scripts/generate-sample-log.mjs` | Produce a large sample log for testing GB-scale performance. |
| `generate-test-fixtures.mjs` | `npm run fixtures` / `:large` | Generate per-language, EOL, encoding, edit-ops and viewer-fallback fixtures for [manual testing](MANUAL_TESTING.md). |
| `run.mjs` | `npm run app` (or `run.cmd` / `run.sh`) | One-click launcher: verifies toolchain, installs deps on first run, then opens the app (`--build` / `--web` variants). |
| `build-installer.mjs` | `npm run app:installer` | Build platform installers (NSIS/MSI/DMG/DEB/RPM/AppImage). |
| `update-deps.mjs` | `npm run update` / `:check` / `:latest` | Cross-platform npm + Cargo dependency updater (see [`UPDATING.md`](UPDATING.md)). |
| `update.cmd` / `update.ps1` / `update.sh` | — | OS-specific launchers for the updater. |

### npm scripts (from `package.json`)

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | `ng serve` — web-only UI (no backend commands). |
| `npm run app` | One-click launcher (`run.cmd` / `run.sh` wrap this). |
| `npm run dev` | `tauri dev` — full app with hot reload. |
| `npm run build` | `ng build` — frontend production build. |
| `npm test` | `ng test` — Karma/Jasmine unit tests. |
| `npm run test:run` | One-shot headless Angular/Jasmine run (CI-style). |
| `npm run test:watch` | Interactive Karma watch mode. |
| `npm run test:rust` | Rust backend unit tests (`cargo test --lib`). |
| `npm run fixtures` / `fixtures:large` | Generate manual-test fixtures into `test-fixtures/`. |
| `npm run sample-log` | Generate / `--follow` a sample log. |
| `npm run app:build` | `tauri build` — production app bundle. |
| `npm run app:build:debug` | Debug bundle. |
| `npm run app:installer[:win/:mac/:linux]` | Platform installers. |
| `npm run update[:check/:latest]` | Dependency maintenance. |

### Backend tests / checks

```bash
cargo test     # run Rust unit tests (from src-tauri/)
cargo check    # type-check without building
```

## 5. Delivery Process (per Prompt.md)

For every feature/phase the workflow is:

1. Explain the implementation plan.
2. Explain architectural decisions & trade-offs.
3. Implement the code (extend, don't rewrite).
4. Update affected files.
5. Add tests where applicable (Jasmine FE, `cargo test` BE).
6. Provide a summary of changes.
7. List remaining work.

**Principles:** reuse existing components, follow project conventions, keep
modules small and DI-friendly, avoid breaking changes, ship production-ready
increments, and always preserve existing read-only GB-log performance.

---

## 6. Delivered Increments

### Increment 1 — View preferences (Phases 2, 9, 12)

- **Word Wrap** toggle (CodeMirror `lineWrapping` compartment).
- **Zoom** in / out / reset (font-size theme compartment).
- **Go to Line** input in the toolbar (uses the existing O(1) line seek).
- **Light / Dark theme** toggle via `data-theme` on the document root, with a
  full CSS-variable light palette in [`src/styles.scss`](../src/styles.scss).
- **Settings persistence** — new
  [`SettingsService`](../src/app/services/settings.service.ts) stores theme,
  word wrap, and font size in `localStorage` (first slice of Phase 12).

All preferences survive reloads and apply to the active and future tabs.
No backend changes were required; the read-only mmap fast path is unchanged.

### Increment 2 — Editable document model (Phases 2, 3, 6)

Adds a true editing mode alongside the read-only GB-log viewer, selected
automatically by file size.

- **Backend** — new [`text_file.rs`](../src-tauri/src/text_file.rs) module +
  commands `open_text`, `save_text`, `max_edit_bytes`. Files ≤ 50 MiB are read
  into memory (no mmap, so the file isn't locked); larger files fall back to the
  viewer. Line endings are detected on open and **preserved on save** (LF/CRLF/CR).
  Covered by unit tests (`cargo test`, 17 passing).
- **Editable view** — new
  [`TextEditorComponent`](../src/app/components/text-editor/text-editor.component.ts)
  built on CodeMirror `basicSetup`: undo/redo, multi-cursor, rectangular
  selection, bracket matching, auto-close brackets, code folding, and CM search
  all work out of the box. Word-wrap and zoom honor the shared settings.
- **App integration** —
  [`EditorService`](../src/app/services/editor.service.ts) bridges the new
  commands; tabs now carry a `mode` (`view` | `edit`), a `dirty` flag (shown as
  `●` in the tab and `*` on the Save button), and per-tab line ending.
- **Commands & shortcuts** — toolbar **New / Save / Save As**, plus
  **Ctrl+N**, **Ctrl+O**, **Ctrl+S**, **Ctrl+Shift+S**. Closing a dirty tab
  prompts for confirmation; Save As uses the native file dialog.

Search / Filter / Follow remain viewer-only (they rely on the backend file
index) and are disabled for editable tabs. The GB-log fast path is untouched.

**Trade-off:** editing keeps the whole file in the renderer, so it is capped at
50 MiB; huge files stay in the windowed read-only viewer. This preserves
Acuvio's core performance guarantee while adding full editing for normal files.

### Increment 3 — Syntax highlighting & language registry (Phase 5)

Adds per-language syntax highlighting for editable documents via a pluggable,
lazily-loaded registry. Full details:
[`features/03-syntax-highlighting.md`](features/03-syntax-highlighting.md).

- **`LanguageRegistry`** service — table of `LanguageDefinition`s, each with a
  dynamic-`import()` loader; detection by exact filename then extension; resolved
  grammars cached by id. New languages register without editor changes.
- **18 built-in languages** — JS, TS, Python, Rust, HTML, XML, JSON, YAML, SQL,
  CSS, Markdown, C/C++, Java, Go, PHP (dedicated packages) + C#, PowerShell,
  Shell (legacy stream modes). All code-split into lazy chunks.
- **Editor integration** — `TextEditorComponent` gains a `languageId` input
  applied through a dedicated CodeMirror compartment, with race-safe async
  resolution.
- **UI** — status-bar language picker (edit mode) with auto-detection on open
  and Save As.

The GB-log viewer keeps its bespoke severity highlighter; source-grammar
highlighting is editable-mode only.

### Increment 4 — Edit operations (Phase 3, Notepad++ Edit menu)

Adds the bulk of Notepad++'s **Edit** menu for editable documents. Full details:
[`features/04-edit-operations.md`](features/04-edit-operations.md).

- **`edit-commands.ts`** — pure, unit-tested `StateCommand`s: sort asc/desc,
  reverse, remove duplicate/empty lines, join, case conversion (UPPER/lower/
  Proper/Sentence/iNVERT), trim trailing/leading, tabs↔spaces.
- **CodeMirror built-ins** wired for duplicate / move / delete line, toggle
  comment, indent more/less.
- **Reusable `DropdownMenuComponent`** hosts the Edit menu (ready for future
  View/Encoding menus).
- **Keybindings** (Notepad++ parity): Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Shift+K, Ctrl+/, Alt+↑/↓.
- **EOL conversion** to LF/CRLF/CR (applied on save).
- **Tests:** 14 Jasmine cases; Karma switched to zoneless — the project's first
  frontend unit tests.

### Increment 5 — Find & Replace (Phase 4, Notepad++ Search menu)

Adds client-side Find & Replace for editable documents. Full details:
[`features/05-find-replace.md`](features/05-find-replace.md).

- **`ReplacePanelComponent`** — presentational find/replace bar (find + replace
  rows, Match Case / Whole Word / Regex toggles, live match count).
- **`TextEditorComponent`** find/replace surface over `@codemirror/search`:
  `setSearch`, `findNext/Previous`, `replaceNext`, `replaceAll`, `countMatches`.
- **Entry points:** `Ctrl+H` and `Ctrl+F` (edit mode) + a toolbar **Replace**
  button; viewer mode still routes `Ctrl+F` to the backend search panel.
- **Replace All** runs in a single transaction (one undo step).
- **Manual coverage:** [`MANUAL_TESTING.md`](MANUAL_TESTING.md) §2.6; fixtures via
  `npm run fixtures`.

### Increment 6 — Advanced line operations & insertions (Phase 3, Notepad++ Edit menu)

Completes the Notepad++ **Edit** menu's Sort / Line / Insert submenus. Full
details: [`features/06-advanced-line-operations.md`](features/06-advanced-line-operations.md).

  `removeConsecutiveDuplicateLines`, `randomizeLines(rng)` (deterministic in
  tests), `insertBlankLineAbove/Below`, and an `insertText(text)` factory.
- **App-level insertions:** Insert Date/Time (short/long) and Copy file
  path / name / directory to clipboard.
- **Tests:** +11 Jasmine cases (**25 total**); numeric sort pushes non-numeric
  lines last, matching Notepad++.
- **Manual coverage:** [`MANUAL_TESTING.md`](MANUAL_TESTING.md) §2.10; new
  `numbers.txt` fixture.

### Increment 7 — View rendering options (Phase 2/9, Notepad++ View menu)

[`features/07-view-rendering-options.md`](features/07-view-rendering-options.md).

- **`SettingsService`** gains persisted `showWhitespace`, `highlightActiveLine`,
  `highlightTrailingWhitespace` signals + toggles.
- **`TextEditorComponent`** maps a `ViewRenderOptions` to a CodeMirror
  compartment (`highlightWhitespace`/`highlightTrailingWhitespace`; active-line
  disabled via a transparent theme override since `basicSetup` bakes it in).
- **`DropdownMenuComponent`** gains a `checked` field rendering a ✓ column; the
  View menu also hosts Word Wrap, Zoom, and Theme for discoverability.
- **Manual coverage:** [`MANUAL_TESTING.md`](MANUAL_TESTING.md) §2.11.

- **`editor/mark.ts`** — pure, unit-tested `findMatches` (escape/whole-word/
  regex/invalid-regex/zero-width) + a `StateField` that recomputes decorations
  only on term change or doc edit.
- **`TextEditorComponent`** — `setMark`/`markSelection`/`clearMark`.
- **Replace bar** gains ⭐ Mark / Clear buttons reusing the find term + options.
- **Tests:** +8 Jasmine cases (**39 total**).
- **Test scripts:** `npm run test:run` / `test:watch` / `test:rust` for manual runs.

### Increment 10 — Brace matching (Phase 4, Notepad++ Search → Matching Brace)

Go-to and select-to matching brace. Full details:
[`features/10-brace-matching.md`](features/10-brace-matching.md).

- **`editor/brace-match.ts`** — pure `findMatchingBracket` wrapping
  `@codemirror/language` `matchBrackets`, multi-probing both sides of the caret.
- **`TextEditorComponent`** — `goToMatchingBrace` / `selectToMatchingBrace`;
  Notepad++ shortcuts Ctrl+B / Ctrl+Shift+B; Search dropdown items.
- **Tests:** +5 Jasmine cases (**44 total**).
- **One-click run:** `run.cmd` / `run.sh` / `npm run app` (see §4).

  `setBookmarksEffect`.
- **`TextEditorComponent`** — `copy/cut/removeBookmarkedLines`,
  `removeNonBookmarkedLines`, `inverseBookmarks`; Search dropdown items.
- **Tests:** +4 Jasmine cases (**48 total**).
- **Cross-platform one-click launchers:** added `run.command` (macOS),
  `Acuvio.desktop` + `scripts/install-linux-launcher.sh` (Linux).

---

### Increment 14 — Large-file open performance (Phase 1, GB-scale handling)

Made opening 100 MB – 4 GB logs feel instant. Full details:
[`features/14-large-file-open-performance.md`](features/14-large-file-open-performance.md).

- **`indexer.rs`** — replaced the byte-by-byte newline scan with SIMD
  `memchr::memchr_iter`; pre-sizes the index from a sampled average line length;
  flushes the first batch after 2 000 lines and emits progress immediately so
  the viewer paints right away (then a 250 k-line cadence).
- **`log_file.rs`** — `reserve_index` pre-allocates the line-start vector.
- **`Cargo.toml`** — added `memchr`; `[profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 3`
  so dependencies run at full speed in dev builds.
- **`log-viewer.component.ts`** — `totalLines` setter refills the first window
  once background indexing makes lines available (no scroll needed).
- **Perf:** real 100 MB / 1.46 M-line log indexes in ~44 ms (~2.2 GB/s);
  ~1.8 s projected for 4 GB, first screen within milliseconds.
- **Tests:** +3 Rust cases for `estimate_line_count` (**20 Rust**, 79 frontend).

## 7. Notepad++ Parity Matrix

Derived from Notepad++'s own menu command IDs (`PowerEditor/src/menuCmdID.h`,
`Notepad_plus.rc`). Tracks coverage of Notepad++'s user-facing menus so features
aren't missed. The **full per-feature catalog** (every menu, with status) lives in
[`notepad-plus-plus-features.md`](notepad-plus-plus-features.md). Legend: ✅ Done · 🟡 Partial · ⬜ Not started.
